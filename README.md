Sentiment Analysis on Twitter COVID19 Dataset
Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted global health, economies, and societies, presenting an unprecedented challenge to public health systems world wide.This project explores sentiment analysis using the Twitter COVID19 dataset, which contains tweets about number of cases, the severity of the case, geograhical locations etc. Employing advanced analytics like regression, SVM, K-means ,Cluster Analysis, time series forecasting, classification models,  recommender systems, we aim to extract actionable insights.
Dataset Information
Dataset Source: Kaggle
Description: The dataset comprises 179108 tweets data and 515800 covid records.  We have two data frames.
1. Tweet data frame : Tweet data frame contains information about tweets, including user details and tweet Meta data. Ideal for analyzing user behavior and content engagement.
2. Data dataframe: tracks COVID-19 cases, including location, details and case counts. The data is crucial for geographic and temporal analysis of the pandemics progression.

Purpose: The dataset serves as a valuable resource for sentiment analysis and natural language processing tasks, offering insights into user perceptions and experiences shared on Twitter.
